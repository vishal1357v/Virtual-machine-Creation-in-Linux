 # VIRTUAL MACHINE CREATION IN LINUX
  ## AIM
  To Install Virtualbox / VMware Workstation with different flavours of linux.
## PROBLEM STATEMENT
This experiment involves setting up a virtual machine with CentOS, a popular Linux distribution. This setup allows users to practice Linux commands, test applications, and develop software in a virtualized environment without affecting the host system.

## ALGORITHM
 ### Steps 1:
Open VirtualBox or VMware Workstation
    
 ### Steps 2:
Go to File -> New to create a new virtual machine.

    
 ### Steps 3:
Enter a name for your CentOS VM.Choose Linux as the type and CentOS as the version (or select the closest option available if CentOS is not listed).
     
 ### Steps 4:
Select the CentOS ISO image you downloaded. Set the base memory to 1024 MB (1 GB) Allocate 1 processor core Set the disk size to at least 20 GB Complete the configuration by clicking Finish to create the virtual machine Step
     
 ### Steps 5:
Select the created VM, go to Details (or Settings), and navigate to the Network tab. Configure Adapter 1 as NAT (for internet access through the host). Configure Adapter 2 as Bridged Adapter (for direct access to the local network, if needed). Click OK to save network settings. 

 ### Step 6:
Click Start to boot up the newly created virtual machine. During installation, set a password for the root user. After logging in to CentOS, open a terminal to start using the command line.
